How to calculate the mass and volume of a rocket fuel tank
######################################################################################

The components of a typical bipropellant rocket fuel tank are as follows.

3 Tank Skirts - One at the top, one in between the tanks, and one at the bottom

3 Intertanks (pressure vessels) - Oxidizer, Fuel, and helium or some other inert gas for pressurization. 

2 External Conduits

4 Feed Lines - From tanks to engines and from helium pressure vessel to both propellant pressure vessels

Fuel tanks have walls which consist of longerons (or stringers) that give stiffness and 
structural integrity. They look much like a typical aircraft air frame.

They also have top and bottom domes called 'heads'.

From wikipedia: 

	A sphere is the ideal shape for a head, because the pressure in 
	the vessel is divided equally across the surface of the head. The radius (r) of 
	the head equals the radius of the cylindrical part of the vessel.

	Ellipsoidal head
	This is also called an elliptical head. The shape of this head is more economical, 
	because the height of the head is just a fraction of the diameter. Its radius varies 
	between the major and minor axis; usually the ratio is 2:1.
